# What is VPC?

* A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
* It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud.
* You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.

## The following are the key concepts for VPCs:

* A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.

* A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

* An internet gateway is a VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
It therefore imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.
